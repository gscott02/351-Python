        "Coding is one of the most useful and transferable skills in the modern age. These Python computer tutorials are designed for physical chemistry class and assumes no previous knowledge of Python or computer science. The goal isn’t to teach you everything about Python, but to give you a gentle introduction through applied learning and practical problem solving so you will be equipped in case you wish to further explore this area.\n",

        "Just like in experimental labs, it's not always practical to try to understand every detail in full. For example, we consider only the basic fundamentals behind the engineering of the lab instruments like the GC-MS or UV-vis. It isn't the best use of our time to fully delve into the materials involved in the construction or the software engineering. As students of physical chemistry, we are interested in the application and the broad scientific implications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Likewise, we will try to understand the big picture in our coding exercises. Don't get too caught up with how every single line or package works! Instead, focus on the concepts and implications for physical chemistry.\n",

        "To do this we need to start by going through the basics of programming in Python. Once you have had some practice writing, editing, and running pieces of Python code, you'll be able to handle more complex programming concepts and start using these to explore some interesting ideas in physical chemistry.\n",
